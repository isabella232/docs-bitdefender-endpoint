<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to uninstall Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for Pivotal Platform from your Pivotal Platform deployment.

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the trash icon on Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for Pivotal Platform tile. 

2. Click **Confirm** in the Delete Product window.

3. Click **Review Pending Changes**, and then click **Apply Changes**.

The tile is removed from the Installation Dashboard and the BOSH Runtime Config. However, the tile still appears in the Available Products view.

<p class="note important">
    <strong>Important: </strong>
You must redeploy to remove the Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools agents from the VMs. 
</p>

<p class="note warning">
    <strong>Warning: </strong>
Do not run the <strong>Uninstall Client</strong> task from the GravityZone console on VMs from your Pivotal Platform deployment.

If you try to uninstall the Linux agent from the GravityZone console, the target machines appear as failing,
because the Pivotal Platform monitor sees that the Bitdefender watchdog process is not running (because it no longer exists).
