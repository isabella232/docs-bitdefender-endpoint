This topic provides instructions for troubleshooting Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for PCF.


##<a id='install'></a>Failed Installations

###<a id='install.symptom'></a>Symptom

PCF deployments fail after the installation of the Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for PCF tile.

###<a id='install.explanation'></a>Explanation

This might happen because the Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools installation on eligible VMs fails.

###<a id='install.solution'></a>Solution

+ Make sure the VM meets the system requirements.

+ Check connectivity from the VM to the deployer selected when configuring the GravityZone package
  (a Relay, Bitdefender Cloud servers or GravityZone on-premises appliance). To troubleshoot this issue, see:

    – [Connectivity requirements for Bitdefender GravityZone Cloud](https://www.bitdefender.com/support/bitdefender-gravityzone-(cloud-console)-communication-ports-1256.html)

    – [Connectivity requirements for Bitdefender GravityZone on-premises deployments](https://www.bitdefender.com/support/gravityzone-communication-ports-1132.html)

For advanced troubleshooting, the Bitdefender support engineers require installation logs:

+ The Linux agent logs to standard error and output at installation time.

+ The Windows agent delivers separate logs in the same location used by BOSH Director to collect them.
Therefore, the logs collected by the BOSH Director for the failing VM deployments will also contain Bitdefender installation logs.
