This topic describes how to install and configure Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for PCF.


##<a id='package'></a>Configure Installation Package in GravityZone

Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for PCF tile downloads
and installs a specific Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools package configured in your GravityZone console.

Here are the best practices to create and configure an installation package in GravityZone for use in a PCF deployment:

1. Connect and log in to GravityZone console using an administrator account.

2. Go to the **Network > Packages** page.

    ![Add Package](network-packages-add.png)

3. Click the **Add** button at the upper side of the table. A configuration window appears.

    ![Package Window](packages-add-window.png)

4. Enter a suggestive name and description for the installation package you want to create. For example, **BEST for PCF**.

5. Select the protection modules you want to install:
    * For Linux deployments, only the Antimalware module is available.
    * For Windows server deployments, you can install additional protection modules beside Antimalware,
      including Advanced Threat Control, Application Control, and Patch Management (if available with your GravityZone license).

    <p class="note important">
    <strong>Important: </strong>
    Make sure the <strong>Relay</strong> checkbox is unselected to avoid installing the agent with Relay role across all VMs and generating high network traffic.
    </p>

6. Configure **Scan Mode**. Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools provides three types of engines:
    * **Local Scan** - most of the scanning activity is performed locally, all signatures and engines stored locally.
    * **Central Scan** - offloads scanning to a Security Server, a dedicated VM that deduplicates
        and centralizes most of the anti-malware functionality of anti-malware agents, acting as a scan server.
    * **Hybrid Scan** – uses a combination of in-the-cloud scanning and a reduced set of local signatures.

    a. **Local Scan** - most of the scanning activity is performed locally, all signatures and engines are stored locally. **Local Scan** requires more local RAM and disk space resources.

    b. **Central Scan** - offloads scanning to a Security Server, a dedicated virtual machine that deduplicates and centralizes most of the anti-malware functionality of anti-malware agents, acting as a scan server. **Central Scan** requires the least local RAM and disk space resources.

    c. **Hybrid Scan** – uses a combination of in-the-cloud scanning and a reduced set of local signatures.

    Choose the scanning technology that best suits your network environment and your endpoints' resources. Keep **Automatic** for predefined defaults or choose **Custom** to configure as needed. If you use **Central Scan**, make sure the virtual machines have connection to a Bitdefender Security Server to perform scanning tasks.
    <p class="note important">
    <strong>Note: </strong>
    To optimize RAM and disk space requirements on virtual machines, use either **Central Scan** or **Hybrid Scan** mode.
    </p>


7. Under the **Settings** section:
    * Disable the **Scan before installation** checkbox to speed up deployment time.
    * You can select **Use custom folders** and choose a custom folder from the GravityZone Network inventory
      where VMs show up automatically after installation, if they do not match an existing GravityZone inventory integration.

8. Under the **Deployer** section, you can choose from where to download the package for installation:
    * By default, this is set to Bitdefender Cloud servers or your GravityZone on-premises server.
    * If you have installed a relay in your IaaS to mirror installation and update files,
      choose **Endpoint Security Relay** and select it from the table or complete the required information.

    <p class="note important">
    <strong>Important: </strong>
    Port 7074 must be open for the deployment through Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools Relay to work.

    </p>
    <p class="note important">
    <strong>Important: </strong>
    At this moment, Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for PCF does not support connectivity via proxy.
    For more information, contact <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/support/contact-us.html?last_page=BusinessCategory" target="_blank">Bitdefender Business Support</a>.
    </p>

9. Click **Save** to create the installation package.

The new package is displayed in the **Network > Packages** page.


<p class="note warning">
    <strong>Warning: </strong>
    Deleting the package from the GravityZone console causes Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools installation to fail.
</p>


##<a id='links'></a>Get Bitdefender Package Download Links

To configure the Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for PCF tile,
you need the package download URLs for Windows and Linux agents,
depending on the operating system running on Pivotal stemcells.

To get the download links from the GravityZone console:

1. In the **Network > Packages** page, select the checkbox corresponding to the package
   you created for use in your PCF environment.

2. Click the **Send download links** icon in the action toolbar.

3. In the new window, click the expanding arrow for **Installation links** section.

4. Copy the corresponding links for **Windows Downloader** and **Linux Installer**.

##<a id='upload'></a>Upload Tile

1. Download the Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for PCF tile from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**.

3. Upload the product file.

4. After uploading, the **Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools** tile appears.
   Initially, the tile is orange, indicating configuration is required. After it is configured, the tile appears green.

##<a id='configure'></a>Configure Tile

The Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for PCF tile from Ops Manager Installation Dashboard contains two forms,
displayed under the Settings tab:

* One for configuring the installation of the Linux agent

* Another for configuring the installation of the Windows agent

<p class="note important">
    <strong>Important: </strong>

    Make sure to configure both Windows and Linux forms with the download URL and appropriate installation target and/or exclusion rules. Pre-configured exclusions are in place for default stemcell operating systems, in order to avoid deploying the Linux agent on a Windows VM or the Windows agent on a Linux VM. Even if you do not plan to deploy on a specific platform (Windows or Linux), you must configure the download URL and add a dummy installation target for that platform.

</p>

After you configure the tile, BOSH Director installs Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools at the same time with other applications,
when deploying the Pivotal VMs.
